# Welcome to the Slender Studios GitHub Page!

## Who Are We?
Slender Studios is a simple team of two technology connoisseurs that thouroughly enjoy using the internet. Connor Bosler, better known as Slender Tech, does most of the work including coding, graphic design, and video editing. Stim McGhouligan, on the other hand, is very much in charge of quality control. He makes sure that everything produced by Connor is ready and presentable for publishing.

#### What Do We Do?

Connor is working on various projects to not only make his internet experience better, but also to make the internet experience of others outstanding in nature. His main project is called Search Crew, which is a fast and light-weight search engine that not only looks gorgious but also works perfectly! Although it is rather simple as of writing, he's actively developing the next version which will add many common features found in modern search engines that are critical for easily finding information. Not only that, but the next version of Search Crew will be much, much more customizable. As of Janurary 6, 2023, the current wokring version of Search Crew is 2.0.4. Connor is also working on developing a web browser, various IDEs pertaining to Search Crew customization, and other services yet to be released. You can stay tuned for updates on [our blog](http://slenderstudios.blogspot.com).

#### What is Something Fun About Us?

Connor & Stim also love products that stand out in the visual department. 'No more of this "flat design" nonsense', we say! We want the slick, professional, and clean look of glossy textures and engraved text. We want to look at skueomorphism. And that's no problem, as all of our apps and services utilize this kind of design language by default! And they always will! If you are not familiar with skeuomorphism, just look up a picture of OS X Mountain Lion. But, just in general, we try to make our apps look like they're from the 2011 - 2013 era of the internet.

## Where Can You Find Us?

Yes, we do have socials. We should probably post to them more than we do.
